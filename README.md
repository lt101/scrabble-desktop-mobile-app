## About
This is a continuation of the web app version of the popular board game Scrabble created in the context of an academic project (see https://github.com/lt101/scrabble-web-app for details). This version includes a multiplayer desktop app built with Electron.js and a mobile app written in Flutter. It implements Socket.io for client-server communication and a REST API for persistance with a MongoDB database.

## How To Use
Before running the application, run the `npm install` script in the *client_web* and *server* directories, as well as *flutter pub get* in *client_mobile* to install necessary dependencies.

    - To build the executable desktop app, run the `npm run build` script in the *client_web* directory. The executable file named *client-lourd* will be found in client_web > build > client-lourd-win32-x64.
    - To run the desktop app without building an executable file, run the `npm start` script in the *client_web* directory.
    - To run the web version of the app, run the `ng serve` script in the *client_web* directory. The client will run on **http://localhost:4200/**.
    
- Mobile app:
    - Open the scrabble-mobile.apk file.
    - If you have an Android emulator, you can run the app on the emulator by running the main.dart file in client_mobile > lib.
